Sure! Here’s a fun, emoji-packed README for your LoggermanLogger with the singleton metaclass:
🦸‍♂️ LoggermanLogger – Your Superhero Logger! 🚀

Say goodbye to boring logs! With LoggermanLogger, your log messages come alive with colors 🌈 and emojis 🎉 — making debugging way more fun and readable!

⸻

Features ✨
	•	🎨 Color-coded logs by level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
	•	🐞🐛 Cute emojis for each log level
	•	🚦 Supports all standard logging levels
	•	🦸‍♀️ Singleton pattern — one logger to rule them all!
	•	🖥️ Logs directly to stdout with pretty formatting
	•	🧹 Automatic color reset (thanks, Colorama!)

⸻

Installation 📦

pip install colorama

Make sure your project includes the src/loggerman folder with:
	•	logger.py (the colorful logger)
	•	singleton.py (the singleton metaclass)

⸻

Usage 🛠️

from src.loggerman.logger import LoggermanLogger

logger = LoggermanLogger(level="DEBUG")

logger.debug("🐞 Debugging is fun!")
logger.info("✨ All systems go!")
logger.warning("⚠️ Something might be wrong...")
logger.error("❌ Uh oh, an error happened!")
logger.critical("💥 Critical failure!!!")


⸻

How it works ⚙️
	•	SingletonMeta ensures only one LoggermanLogger instance ever exists.
	•	Each log level gets its own color + emoji.
	•	Logs print like this:

🐞 [2025-08-10 14:22:11] [Loggerman] DEBUG: Debugging is fun!
